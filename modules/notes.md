## Module 1: The different types of Machine Learning

Generally, there are 3 types of Python packages:

  - Operational packages: They load, structure and prepare the dataset for further analysis (E.g., Pandas, Numpy, Scipy).
  - Data Visualization packages: They allow you to create plots and graphics of data (E.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly).
  - Machine Learning packages: They give many functions to help build models from a dataset, along with functionality to examine the model once it has been built (E.g., Sklearn).

Apart from these, Python has thousands and thousands of packages publicly available.
